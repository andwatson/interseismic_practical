# interseismic_practical

Practical exercise on interseismic strain accumulation for the COMET InSAR course.

To launch the practical notebook (use this if you want to run through the practical):
- [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andwatson/interseismic_practical/Qi?filepath=Interseis_practical.ipynb)

If that notebook fails to launch, try this one instead:
- [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andwatson/interseismic_practical/main?filepath=Interseis_practical.ipynb)

To launch the full repo (use this if you want to experiment with the code):
- [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andwatson/interseismic_practical/main)

The practical can also be run locally using Jupyter Notebooks. You'll find the required python packages in `environment.yml`.

### Acknowledgements

Detailed guidance on the content was provided by John Elliott. Advice on the computational requirements of the practical was provided by Richard Rigby. This notebook was written using resources from the Tectonophysics (Tim Wright) and Inverse Theory (Phil Livermore) undergraduate modules at the University of Leeds. The strain rate sections were written by, and with the help of, Qi Ou. Thanks to everyone for their contributions.
