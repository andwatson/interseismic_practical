    "The earthquake cycle is a model for how earthquakes occur on faults. It consists of three phases:\n",
    "- **Interseismic** - the fault is locked towards the surface but is accumulating strain at depth driven by external forces (i.e. plate motion).\n",
    "- **Coseismic** - the strain is released seismically by slip on the previously-locked section of the fault.\n",
    "- **Postseismic** - mechanisms after the earthquake such as afterslip or viscoelastic relaxation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be focusing on the interseismic period for this practical. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of how the ground deforms through the interseismic period (middle panel) and into the coseismic (right panel). Profile A-A' shows a characteristic interseismic signal in the middle panel (the shape of an arctan function), where the ground displacement decreases from the far-field to zero at the fault trace.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can model interseismic deformation by considering steady slip on a screw dislocation embedded within an elastic half-space (Savage and Burford, 1973, Wright et al., 2013). In this simple model, the fault-parallel surface velocities, $v$, are a function of the perpendicular distance from the fault, $x$, the slip rate, $s$, and the locking depth, $d$:\n",

    "**2)** Loading in our LiCSBAS velocities and other data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3)** Decomposing our two line-of-sight velocity maps into both East and vertical velocities, under the assumption of zero North velocity, and into fault-parallel and vertical velocities, under the assumption of zero fault-perpendicular velocity. This includes resampling our velocities onto a unified grid and setting a common reference point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4)** Projecting the fault-parallel velocities onto a fault-perpendicular profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5)** Performing a forward model to explore our profiled velocities.\n",

InSAR is also only capable of measuring displacements towards and away from the satellite.

We take some prior knowledge about the model (e.g. limits of the model parameter values) and combine this with a likelihood function based on the observations to estimate the posterior probability (i.e. the likelihood of our model parameters being the true values given the data). By exploring a range of model parameter values, we can build up a a posterior probability distribution which tells us both our \"best fit\" values, known as the \"maximum a posteriori probability (MAP)\" solution, and allows us to estimate the uncertainties on this solution.\n",

    "- $0 \\leq s \\leq 40$ mm/yr\n",

    "- $-10 \\leq c \\leq 10$ mm/yr\n",

    "where $W$ contains the weight for every velocity. Weighting the data is useful when some velocities have larger errors than others. For simplicity, we'll assume a uniform uncertainty of 1 mm/yr (1 standard deviation) across all of our velocities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to explore the posterior distribution (i.e. test a large number of model parameter values) we'll use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.\n",
    "Our MCMC performs the following steps:\n",
    "- Take a starting model and add a random step to each parameters.\n",

    "So far we've assumed that the NAF is locked from the surface down to a given depth, below which the fault is slipping aseismically. This gives a fault-parallel velocity of zero at the fault trace. Depending on where you have drawn your profile lines so far, you may have noticed a step in the velocities across the fault that is larger than the noise level. This may be fault creep, where the fault is also slipping aseismically at a shallow depth up to the surface. This fault creep occurs alongside the deeper interseismic slip.\n",

This models the creep as the sum of slip on the entire fault plane using a Heaviside function ($H$) plus a screw dislocation in the opposite sense to the plate motion at depth $d_2$. We also retain the static offset, $c$, and include a new offset to the fault location, $x_c$.
